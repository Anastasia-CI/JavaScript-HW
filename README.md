JavaScript HW.
Here are some assignments showing how to work with different types of data in JavaScript.

Exercise 1
Write a program that works as follows: A value is entered into prompt. Use the unary plus (arithmetic operator) to convert it to a number, then use typeof to check if it belongs to the Number set.
If it is a number, print to the console whether it is even or odd.
If it is not a number, print, "Oops, it looks like you made a mistake.

Exercise 2
Given a variable x that can take any value. Write a program that, depending on the type of data x, outputs a message to the console like: "x is a number."
Describe three cases: when x = number, string, or logical type. In other cases, print the message, "The type x is undefined".

Exercise 3
You are given a string. You need to output an inverted version to the console. For example, "Hello" -> "olleH".

Exercise 4
Write a random integer in the range [0; 100] into a variable. Use a Math object.

Exercise 5
Here is an arbitrary array. You should print the number of array elements, then go through the array and print each element of the array to the console.

Exercise 6
You have an array. Check if the array elements are the same and print the result true or false to the console. We are not talking about two identical elements next to each other, but all of them. Check if all elements of the array are the same.

Exercise 7
Given an array. Display in the console the number of even and odd elements in the array. If there is a zero element in the array, it is taken into account and displayed separately. 
When performing the task, note that the array can contain not only numbers, but also, for example, signs, null, and so on.

Exercise 8
Create an arbitrary Map array. Get its keys and output all values to the console as "Key - X, value - Y".
